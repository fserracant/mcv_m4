%% Lab 1: Image rectification


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% 1. Applying image transformations

% ToDo: create the function  "apply_H" that gets as input a homography and
% an image and returns the image transformed by the homography.
% The size of the transformed image has to be automatically set so as to 
% contain the whole transformed image.
% At some point you will need to interpolate the image values at some points,
% you may use the Matlab function "interp2" for that.


%% 1.1. Similarities
I=imread('Data/0005_s.png'); % we have to be in the proper folder

% ToDo: generate a matrix H which produces a similarity transformation

I2 = apply_H(I, H);
figure; imshow(I); figure; imshow(uint8(I2));


%% 1.2. Affinities

% ToDo: generate a matrix H which produces an affine transformation

I2 = apply_H(I, H);
figure; imshow(I); figure; imshow(uint8(I2));

% ToDo: decompose the affinity in four transformations: two
% rotations, a scale, and a translation

% ToDo: verify that the product of the four previous transformations
% produces the same matrix H as above

% ToDo: verify that the proper sequence of the four previous
% transformations over the image I produces the same image I2 as before



%% 1.3 Projective transformations (homographies)

% ToDo: generate a matrix H which produces a projective transformation

I2 = apply_H(I, H);
figure; imshow(I); figure; imshow(uint8(I2));

%% 2. Affine Rectification


% choose the image points
I=imread('Data/0000_s.png');
A = load('Data/0000_s_info_lines.txt');

% indices of lines
i = 424;
p1 = [A(i,1) A(i,2) 1]';
p2 = [A(i,3) A(i,4) 1]';
i = 240;
p3 = [A(i,1) A(i,2) 1]';
p4 = [A(i,3) A(i,4) 1]';
i = 712;
p5 = [A(i,1) A(i,2) 1]';
p6 = [A(i,3) A(i,4) 1]';
i = 565;
p7 = [A(i,1) A(i,2) 1]';
p8 = [A(i,3) A(i,4) 1]';

% ToDo: compute the lines l1, l2, l3, l4, that pass through the different pairs of points


% show the chosen lines in the image
figure;imshow(I);
hold on;
t=1:0.1:1000;
plot(t, -(l1(1)*t + l1(3)) / l1(2), 'y');
plot(t, -(l2(1)*t + l2(3)) / l2(2), 'y');
plot(t, -(l3(1)*t + l3(3)) / l3(2), 'y');
plot(t, -(l4(1)*t + l4(3)) / l4(2), 'y');

% ToDo: compute the homography that affinely rectifies the image

I2 = apply_H(I, H);
figure; imshow(uint8(I2));

% ToDo: compute the transformed lines lr1, lr2, lr3, lr4

% show the transformed lines in the transformed image
figure;imshow(uint8(I2));
hold on;
t=1:0.1:1000;
plot(t, -(lr1(1)*t + lr1(3)) / lr1(2), 'y');
plot(t, -(lr2(1)*t + lr2(3)) / lr2(2), 'y');
plot(t, -(lr3(1)*t + lr3(3)) / lr3(2), 'y');
plot(t, -(lr4(1)*t + lr4(3)) / lr4(2), 'y');

% ToDo: to evaluate the results, compute the angle between the different pair 
% of lines before and after the image transformation


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% 3. Metric Rectification

%% 3.1 Metric rectification after the affine rectification (stratified solution)

% ToDo: Metric rectification (after the affine rectification) using two non-parallel orthogonal line pairs
%       As evaluation method you can display the images (before and after
%       the metric rectification) with the chosen lines printed on it.
%       Compute also the angles between the pair of lines before and after
%       rectification.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% 4. Affine and Metric Rectification of the left facade of image 0001

% ToDo: Write the code that rectifies the left facade of image 0001 with
%       the stratified method (affine + metric). 
%       Crop the initial image so that only the left facade is visible.
%       Show the (properly) transformed lines that use in every step.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% 5. OPTIONAL: Metric Rectification in a single step
% Use 5 pairs of orthogonal lines (pages 55-57, Hartley-Zisserman book)
