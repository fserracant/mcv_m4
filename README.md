# 3D recovery of Urban Scenes in Computer Vision

[Module 4][m4] Project from [Master in Computer Vision Barcelona][master] program.

The goal of this project is to learn the basic concepts and techniques 
to reconstruct a real world scene given several images (points of view) 
of it, not necessarily previously calibrated. In this project we focus 
on 3D recovery of Urban Scenes using images of different datasets, 
namely images of facades and aerial images of cities.

This project can be useful in different applications where some 3D  
information has tobe inferred from images taken at different points of 
view. Examples of such kind of applications are: image mosaics or 
panoramas, augmented reality, depth computation, 3D reconstruction, 3D 
localization and navigation, new view synthesis.
