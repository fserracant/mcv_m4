function H = homography2d(x1, x2)
% TODO: implement this function.
% It should compute the homography based on two sets of points x1, x2
% (correspondences) between two views of the same scene.
% x1 and x2 are sets of 4 points randomly sampled out of all the
% correspondences (see 'ransac_homography_adaptive_loop.m').
